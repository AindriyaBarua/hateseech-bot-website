# hateseech-bot-website
WIP: Website for Shor.ai, done during Without Fear Fellowship: The Bachchao Project

Hosted here: https://AindriyaBarua.github.io/hateseech-bot-website

After discussing with the team, we decided to make a website that would cater to victims of hate speech. It would be a website that would show up when a person searches what to do when they are being abused online.

What the website does:
The website helps the victim realise they aren’t powerless when subjected to hate speech or online violence.
The website acts as an accumulator of three kinds of resources:
Legal Resources:
The user can enter comments and the website would analyze it and tell if the comment      violates any laws, and the exact IPC sections the comment can be punishable under, hence it would also have a link to lodge a complaint if the victim wants.
Technical Resources:
An updated compilation of measures social media platforms themselves provide to help with hate speech, offensive content, trolling, etc and tutorials on how to use them.
Mental Health Resources:
From personal experience, mass trolling and hate speech may lead to panic attacks, anxiety, etc, so we also thought of adding a compilation of mental health professionals they could seek.
This will also be a site where people can download the hate speech bot I am building, for free. Since this is my broader goal, this will remain a site where my work will always have to be hosted, and thus I will automatically be taking up the responsibility of upholding and maintaining the resources we are building through this fellowship.
