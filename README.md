After discussing with the team, we decided to make a website that would cater to victims of hate speech. It would be a website that would show up when a person searches what to do when they are being abused online.

What the website does:
The website helps the victim realise they arenâ€™t powerless when subjected to hate speech or online violence.
The website acts as an accumulator of three kinds of resources:
Legal Resources:
The user can enter comments and the website would analyze it and tell if the comment      violates any laws, and the exact IPC sections the comment can be punishable under, hence it would also have a link to lodge a complaint if the victim wants.
Technical Resources:
An updated compilation of measures social media platforms themselves provide to help with hate speech, offensive content, trolling, etc and tutorials on how to use them.
Mental Health Resources:
From personal experience, mass trolling and hate speech may lead to panic attacks, anxiety, etc, so we also thought of adding a compilation of mental health professionals they could seek.
This will also be a site where people can download the hate speech bot I am building, for free. Since this is my broader goal, this will remain a site where my work will always have to be hosted, and thus I will automatically be taking up the responsibility of upholding and maintaining the resources we are building through this fellowship.

Though this website was the best idea to utilize the different areas of expertise of the teammates, web development is not my field. I am purely an AI engineer, and my broader work is collecting and analyzing Indian hate speech data, identifying hate speech with Natural Language Processing, and automating the removal of multi-modal hate speech from text, images, and videos from social media platforms as well as warn, block, report users of hate speech. Yet, for this project, I realized it would be more beneficial for victims of online abuse if I could build a website, so, even though it would be hard for me, I thought it would be worth the effort. 

Since I was not confident of how difficult or easy it would be to build a website, for the 10th January deadline, we decided to keep the site static and only host the legal resources as a static page. In the process, I learned how to  build a fully functional static website, and also hosted it on Github: https://AindriyaBarua.github.io/hateseech-bot-website

But now that that got done, I feel more confident and I am hoping to learn Javascript and also learn to host a dynamic webpage, with the server side on Heroku. By the end of January, I am hoping to build a dynamic site, where the victim of online abuse can enter the hate comments and the website would tell which specific laws are being violated, and hence if they can lodge a complaint. If not, the user would be directed to the other measures in the technical and mental health resources.
